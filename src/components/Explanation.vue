          <p>A few days ago, one of our closest IRL friend lost his father just one week after losing his brother, two people he was living with since he was a child.</p>
          <p>While we try to spend most of our time with him to cheer him up, we felt that it was not enough. This is why we thought about a donation-based crowdfunding.</p>
          <p>To thank you for your support, we want to gift you a unique NFT for every 0.05 EGLD donation (approximately 10$).</p>
          <p>The goal is to help him with expenses he is having in this difficult moment. We thank you from the bottom of our heart.</p>

          <p class="text-bold q-mt-none q-mt-xl q-mb-md"></p>
        <p>Any donation is very much appreciated. However, if you donate at least 0.05 EGLD, you will receive automatically one NFT.</p>
        <p class="bg-yellow">Now, if you wish to purchase several NFTs we advise you to donate n times 0.05 EGLD, n being the number of NFTs you want.</p>
        <p>There are no royalties, so if you want to sell the NFT you will receive the full amount of the sale (minus the marketplace fee).</p>
